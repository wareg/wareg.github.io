# Freestyle JavaScript Game

## Story

By now you know the Javascript basics. Lets put it to a test and create something awesome, creative and motivating. The goal is to create a game in the browser. What type of game?

Wait for it...

Any type :) Just your creativity (and your JavaScript knowledge) can limit the result.

## What are you going to learn?

- finding DOM elements in the document tree
- DOM manipulation using JavaScript
- handling user interactions with JavaScript event handlers
- HTML data attributes
- CSS styling

## Tasks

1. As a team you should figure out what game you want to work on and what features you want to finish.
    - There is a game that the whole team agrees you would like to implement
    - Checked your game idea with a mentor to make sure it can be realistically implemented in a sprint
    - There is a backlog of possible features you have collected that the game can have
    - There is a plan based on story estimations what you can finish by the end of the sprint

2. We want to have a playable game based on JavaScript DOM manipulation and event handling
    - The game is based on handling some kind of event(s) (mouse, keyboard...)
    - The game mainly relies on DOM manipulation to move elements around on the screen or change their appearance (beside CSS of course)
    - The code is separated into several javascript functions

3. [OPTIONAL] The game or parts of it can be time driven. This adds some complexity as you have to change things around in given time intervals
    - There is a part of the game that changes over time without any interaction (eg. moving enemy/avatar)

4. [OPTIONAL] There should be a way to check my highest score.
    - The highscore data is stored between games
