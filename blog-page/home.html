                <div class="cell post-text"> It’s been a while since I’ve done a full-on chocolate review, but when Kate and Janet from 
                    The Mallow Tailor got in touch and asked if I’d like to try some of their filled chocolates, 
                    I couldn’t say no. After all, it’s 2020 and I deserve a little more quality chocolate in my life.
                    
                    As is often the case, it turns out that saying yes to chocolate was a good decision on my part.
                    
                    Based in the Brecon Beacons area of South Wales, The Mallow Tailor specialise in beautiful 
                    chocolates filled marshmallow, caramel and fruit ganaches. And as you can see, first impressions 
                    are very good!</div>

                <div class="cell post-text">Regular readers will know I’m a big fan of Jennifer Earle’s Chocolate Ecstasy Tours; walking tours of some of London’s best chocolate shops and sweet treat establishments.
                    
                    Unfortunately, the current pandemic has meant that these tours have had to go on hold, and 
                    Jen has had to look for other ways to keep the spirit of the tours going, while giving a 
                    much needed boost to some of the smaller chocolatiers and chocolate makers who have 
                    struggled during the lockdown period. To that end, she has come up with a couple of great 
                    ideas for finding great chocolate without ever leaving the comfort of your home.
                    
                    First up, Jen has created a directory of online sellers, an extensive list of small 
                    producers in the UK who are selling sweet treats and baked goods online. It’s a great place 
                    to find a chocolate gift for a loved one or a pick-me-up for yourself!
                    
                    More recently, she has introduced a new and exciting idea, the Online Mystery Chocolate 
                    Tasting, and she was kind enough to send me a tasting pack for the latest tasting.</div>

                <div class="cell post-head"><h3>Bouvery CV Chocolate Vodka</h3></div>
                <div class="cell post-text"> Back in 2013, I participated in a focus group for a new chocolate liqueur drink. That 
                    product was launched as Baileys Chocolat Luxe later that year, and it was fair to say I 
                    wasn’t a fan of it from the start. Ostensibly a more chocolatey Bailey’s made with ‘Belgian 
                    chocolate’, it turned out not to be especially chocolatey and had an unappetising curdled 
                    appearance when poured.
                    
                    I personally found Thorntons offering preferable to the the Baileys, but I’ve always felt it 
                    must be possible to do it better. It’s not just a matter of choosing better quality 
                    ingredients – although that certainly goes a long way. The difficult part is getting 
                    chocolate to stay in suspension in a drink with a luxurious and smooth texture.
                    
                    But with Bouvery CV, a vodka based chocolate drink, it seems someone might have finally 
                    cracked it.</div>

                <div class="cell post-head"><h3>Vanini Organic Uganda Range</h3></div>
                <div class="cell post-text"> Nuts seem to be something of a theme around here at the moment. Hot on the heels of the Amedei 
                    Prendimé range bars I recently reviewed, ICAM sent this colourful looking range from their 
                    Vanini brand.These bars are a little different from the Amedei range though. 

                    The immediately noticeable difference is bean origin. Whereas Amedei make no mention of 
                    origin at all, the Uganda origin of the Vanini bars is celebrated. In fact, ICAM have been 
                    working in Uganda for a number of years, with over 5,000 smallholder farmers directly 
                    supplying the company with beans to the company’s local cocoa collection and processing 
                    facility.
                    
                    I’m not in a position to judge the ethics or sustainability of one chocolate maker against 
                    another, particularly as I was sent both sets of bars without comment. What I will say is 
                    that as a chocolate consumer, I would much rather know where the beans have come from, so I 
                    can do my own research if I want to.</div>
