# Travel Agency

## Story

You (the team) just founded a small creative developer agency.
You had a few successful projects, but you had been waiting for your big chance to proove your skills.
The big opportunity is here: 
A youthful, booming, innovative travel agency are looking forward to sitebuild their webdesign. 
They entrusted your team with the project. Their UI/UX designer is really famous so it will be a really good reference in your portfolio.

Your team choose one from the 3 AI files and recreate it in HTML/SVG/CSS.
The page must be responsive and the proportion of the height/width must be constant, but you can resize or leave out as many elements as needed to keep it mobile friendly.
You can choose which part will become HTML, inline SVG code or SVG file, the goal is to have a web page that looks like the template.

## What are you going to learn?

- Using vector graphics
- Modern web design
- Build from AI files

## Tasks

1. Recreate one of the templates as an HTML page. The CSS properties of the different elements must match with those from the template.

2. Make the page responsive.
    - The layout does not collapse with the window size changing

## Hints

- If your system doesn't contain the font familys from the starting files, you can find them in Google Fonts.
- Mesure every parameter you can. Font-weight, font-size, space-lining, etc... 
These are important properties to be as precise as it's expected, mostly if you work from a template.
