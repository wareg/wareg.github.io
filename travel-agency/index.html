                Iceland is one of the world’s most incredible destinations, largely due to it’s jaw-dropping natural
                landscape. It has everything from
                lava fields to glaciers. It’s a dream destination if you love the great outdoors and exploring
                everything that nature has to offer.
                However, planning a tour of Iceland and organizing the logistics by yourself can quickly turn into a
                nightmare, as you’ll have loads
                of questions about how to get the best out of your vacation.

                <h1>Overwhelming<br>Questions</h1>
                Some of your questions might include: How can you possibly decide what’s worth seeing when there are so many things to choose from like
                volcanos, geysers, waterfalls, hot water springs, basalt columns, huge crevices, glaciers, lagunes, and mud pools, and when several months
                wouldn’t be enough to see it all?
                <ul>
                    <li>Once you do have a rough itinerary, how can it be arranged so that it doesn’t cost an arm and a leg?</li>
                    <li>Where should you book your stay and what should you eat in a country where a bed in a hostel can cost 100 euros a night?</li>
                    <li>What is the best time of year to go so the inclement weather doesn’t ruin your plans?</li>
                    <li>Is it better to go in winter when it’s cold and dark, or in summer when it’s light for 20 hours each day?</li>

                <h1>BTS Has<br>the Answers</h1>
                <p>Beyond the Standard’s answers to these tricky questions is two campervan tours of Iceland; one in the
                    winter, one in summer. Each tour
                    is organized by local Icelandic tour guides who jam pack the tour with both the absolute must-see
                    sights and hidden gems.</p>
                <p> The campervan is a transformed mini bus with heating, a table, chairs, a basic kitchen, a bed and
                    bedding. By going with a campervan,
                    you’ll get the spontaneity and adventure of backpacking, while also enjoying the comfort of a hotel
                    stay. There’s always a place you can escape to when you need a moment, and you’ll have a warm bed to
                    sleep in at the end of a long and
                    exciting day.</p>
                <p> It’s important to be flexible when touring Iceland. Your tour guides will keep an eye on the weather
                    forecasts, and things can always
                    be adapted if rain clouds make the existing plan tricky. In a country where it rains almost every
                    day, the best kind of tour is one
                    that can escape the clouds at a moment's notice. By keeping an eye on the weather and trying to
                    steer clear of clouds, we have the
                    best chance of seeing the northern lights during the winter tour.</p>
                <p> In Iceland, forward thinking and planning is super important, when it comes to keeping the reins on
                    our budget too. One of the ways we
                    keep the cost of our tour affordable, is by shopping for local ingredients together and cooking
                    meals on our campervan’s grill.</p>
                <p> Surprisingly, there are some things in Iceland, which are actually cheaper than in other parts of
                    the world. These include world-class
                    lamb hearts, cod, crustaceans, lamb, and beef. Forget that old stereotype of fermented shark meat!

            <h2>D1 — <span>Arrival, hot river, and lava tunnel</span> (100 km)</h2>
            <p>
                Arriving at Keflavík airport, we’ll pick up our campervans. Then we’ll travel to the island’s south western corner to Hveragerði. Here
                we’ll check out the bubbling hot springs, and enjoy an excursion to the boiling lake where you can also bathe if you wish. Nearby,
                we’ll visit a lava tunnel, which is several thousands of years old. If you’re brave enough you can even climb inside.</p>
            <h2>D2 — <span>Geysers, waterfalls, and natural baths</span> (230 km)</h2>
            <p>Iceland’s most famous sight has got to be Geysir, after which geysers got their name. Gullfoss is the most famous of Iceland’s
                waterfalls, and after visiting it, we’ll explore another waterfall called Skógafoss from above, underneath, outside, and inside. We’ll
                actually spend tonight at the foot of this waterfall. For those who still have energy to burn, we’ll visit the outdoor swimming pool
                at Seljavallalaug, which is half natural and half man-made.</p>
            <h2>D3 — <span>Basalt columns, canyon, glacier</span> (180 km)</h2>
            <p>First up, we’ll visit the beautiful black basalt columns at Reynisfjara, which is situated on an impressive black sandy beach. Then,
                we’ll visit a stunning canyon before spending the night at Skaftafell at the foot of the Vatnajökull glacier.</p>
            <h2>D4 — <span>Icebergs, seals, and Scandinavian townships</span> (140 km)</h2>
            <p>In the morning we’ll climb up a hill and look out to see how icebergs and ice walls separate from the glacier and float out into the
                ocean. In what promises to be a magical moment, seals will play all around us. We’ll spend the evening in a small town called Höfn,
                where they serve the best lobster in all of Iceland. There’s also a great pool in Höfn where we can soak in the warm water or zip down
                water slides.</p>
            <h2>D5 — <span>Fishing village, fjords, northern lights</span> (420 km)</h2>
            <p> We’ll drive a lot, but the upside is that we’ll travel along the most beautiful scenic route available. We’ll pass fewer and fewer
                cars as we head to the north-west of the island. We’ll stop by a fishing village on the banks of a fjord, which would actually be the
                perfect set for a Wes Anderson film. We’ll spend the night right up north, on the banks of the Myvatn lake. If we’re lucky and it’s a
                clear night, we’ll be able to see the northern lights, too.</p>
            <h2>D6 — <span>Bright blue thermal waters, a geothermal display, lava fields, and the north’s capital Akureyri</span> (120 km)</h2>
            <p>Before we go swimming in what could be one of Iceland’s most beautifully bright blue thermal baths, we’ll visit an incredibly active
                geothermal display, full of bubbling mud pots and steam rising from the earth. Here at Hverirt we’ll also visit a lava field and the
                world's largest geothermal power plant. We’ll spend the night in Akureyri, which is Iceland's second biggest city. Tonight we’ll sleep
                not in our campervan but in a capsule hotel, which you might recognize if you’re into Japanese sci-fi.</p>
